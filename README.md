The simulation study extends that of [Li, Plagborg-Møller, and Wolf (2024)](https://github.com/dake-li/lp_var_simul) with estimation routines based on the replication materials for [Montiel Olea, Plagborg-Møller, Qian, and Wolf (2024)](https://github.com/ckwolf92/lp_var_inference).

We rely on the BVAR code of [Domenico Giannone, Michele Lenza, and Giorgio Primiceri](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/gep575/GLPreplicationWeb.zip) and the penalized LP code of [Regis Barnichon and Christian Brownlees](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fjzw-U3hjIl467KXywRqeQod2jdHOmDo). We also use the Dynamic Factor Model code and data of [Eben Lazarus, Daniel Lewis, Jim Stock, and Mark Watson](http://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/ddisk/LLSW_ReplicationFiles_071418.zip), modified to allow for conditional heteroskedasticity of the shocks for both the factors and idiosyncratic disturbances.
